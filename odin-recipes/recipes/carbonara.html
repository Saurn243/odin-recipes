    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It’s one of Rome’s signature dishes, and just like cacio e pepe and other pasta recipes in that class, 
            its simplicity demands proper technique and quality ingredients.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 3 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more
        <li> 4 oz. guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), pancetta (Italian bacon), or bacon
        <li> 2 oz. Parmesan or Pecorino Romano
        <li> 4 large egg yolks
        <li> 2 large eggs
        <li> Freshly ground black pepper
        <li> 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
        <li> 1 lb. spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni                
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 6 qt. water in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt and cover pot with a lid (this will bring water to a boil faster).
        <li>While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove 4 oz. guanciale from packaging and cut into about 1x¼" strips. Finely grate 2 oz. cheese and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.
        <li>Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining grated cheese. Add several cranks of pepper and set aside.
        <li>Working next to pot, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7–10 minutes.
        <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 3 Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.
        <li>Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes shy of package instructions. Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.
        <li>Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.
        <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and water is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.
        <li>Whisk ¼ cup reserved pasta water into egg mixture, then very slowly stream into Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if needed. Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won’t use all of it).        
        <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.        
    </ol>
